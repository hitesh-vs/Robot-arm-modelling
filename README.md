# Modelling of Multi DoF Manipulator in MATLAB & Simulink

## Overview

This repository contains files for the modeling and simulation of a multi-degree-of-freedom (DoF) manipulator in the Simulink environment from scratch. The provided code allows you to simulate the manipulator's motion and test various control strategies. The code uses MATLAB's Robotic Systems Toolbox to imlpement algorithms like BFGS and Levenberg-Marquardt to solve for the inverse kinematics.

## Features

- **Forward Kinematics**: The code implements forward kinematics to calculate the end-effector's pose (position and orientation) given the joint angles of the manipulator.

- **Inverse Kinematics**: Inverse kinematics algorithms are implemented to determine the joint angles required to achieve a desired end-effector pose.
